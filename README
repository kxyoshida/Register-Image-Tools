Read PolishedSpots of the alignement beads and make a table of paired distance.
Find the five nearest beads. Sort the nearest distance in descending order so
that beads in the sparse area will be on the top of the list. Compare the paired
distance and x, y location in green and red tables and find the candidate
pair. Then calculate the transform coefficients and evaluate the error. Remove
the pair with which the error exceeds limit and re-calculate the transform
coefficients
